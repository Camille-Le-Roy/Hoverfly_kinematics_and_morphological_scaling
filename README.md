## Description

This repository contains the complete suite of R scripts used to reproduce the analyses from the research article:  

**Adaptations in wing morphology rather than wingbeat kinematics enable flight in small hoverfly species** (_eLife_, 2025)
DOI: [10.7554/eLife.97839.2](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/97839v2)

The code covers the following stages of the analysis pipeline:  

- Analysis of wingbeat kinematics data  
- Analysis of kinematic and morphological scaling  
- Geometric morphometric analysis of wing shape  
- Analysis of CFD simulation results  

These scripts are provided **as-is** for the purposes of transparency and reproducibility. They may not be optimized for general use.
