## Repository Description

This repository contains the complete suite of R scripts required to reproduce the analyses presented in the research article:

*Adaptations in wing morphology rather than wingbeat kinematics enable flight in small hoverfly species* (_eLife_, 2025).

The code covers the following stages of the analysis pipeline:

- Analysis of wingbeat kinematics data
- Analysis of kinematic and morphological scaling
- Geometric Morphometric analysis of wing shape
- Analysis of CFD simulation results


These scripts were developed for the analyses in *Adaptations in wing morphology rather than wingbeat kinematics enable flight in small hoverfly species* and may not be optimized for general use. They are provided as-is for transparency and reproducibility.
